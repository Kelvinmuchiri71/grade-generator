# Speed detector

The Speed Detecor program calculates whether a driver is within the speed limit, issues demerit points if they exceed the limit, and suspends their license if they accumulate too many points.

The program checks if the speed is within the legal limit, calculates demerit points for every 5 km per second over the speed limit, and suspends the license if the driver accumulates more than 12 demerit points.

// How the program works
If the speed is less than or equal to 70, the program returns "Ok".
If the speed is above 70, the program calculates demerit points for every 5km/s over the speed limit (70).
And if the demerit points exceed 12 points, the program returns "License suspended"
